When I first created the EC2 instance for my senior project, I only made it to have one 8GB volume, which was wildly insufficient. Thus, I had to create another extra volume and attach it to the instance. Here's how to do it:

1. First, go to the EC2 Instances tab, and select **Volume**. Click **Create Volume** to create a brand new EBS volume. Choose the volume type and size of the drive. Remember to choose the availability zone to be the same availability zone as the EC2 instance you're going to attach it to. Click **Create Volume** once done.

2. The EBS volume will take a while to prepare. Once it's available, right click on it and select **Attach Volume**.

3. Choose the instance ID of the EC2 instance you want to attach this EBS volume to. Note that only the instances in the same availability zone will be available. You can choose the device type or leave it as default. Select **Attach**.

Once you're done attaching the EBS volume to the EC2 instance, you can check that the instance now has another extra volume using the command `lsblk`. However, it is not ready for use yet. In order to get the volume in use, follow the instructions in [my previous blog](https://tinyvogon.github.io/blog/2021/02/10/Sp21-Blog0.html).
