The CSS Box Model contains 4 parts: Content, Padding, Border, Margin.

This illustration shows how different these 4 parts of the box model are. 
**Content:** the text or image that is the centre point of the box.

**Padding:** the area between the outermost/border of the box and the content inside the box.

**Border:**  the line at the edge of the box that wraps around the content and padding, separating the box and the rest of the page.

**Margin:** the space between the box and the adjacent boxes. 

Now that you understood the difference between the parts of CSS box model, you can use CSS rules to build your html page by modifying the padding, margin, border properties.
