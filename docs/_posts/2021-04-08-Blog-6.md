Security group is an essential part of EC2 instance - it acts as a firewall limiting traffic in and out of the server. This article will detail on how to modify/change the security group attached to an existing EC2 instance using the AWS console and AWS CLI.

*Using AWS Console:*


1. First, go to the EC2 Instances tab. Right click on the instance, choose **Security -> Change security group**.

2. In the *Associated security group* box, find your preferred security group and click **Add security group**. You can also remove the previously associated security group by clicking on **Remove** button next to the old security group. Click **Save** and the changes will be applied immediately without an instance reboot.

*Using AWS CLI:*

It's a much faster process with CLI. You just need to open your Command prompt/ cmd, make sure that aws configure is configured correctly with your access keys, and execute this command:

`aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id [instance-id-value] --groups [security-group-id-value]`


where instance id value would be the id of your EC2 instance (e.g: i-XXXXXXXX), and security group id value would be the id of your preferred security group (e.g: sg-XXXXXXX)
