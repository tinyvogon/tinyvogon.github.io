Although Access is considered outdated these days, a lot of databases, mostly legacy, are written for Access and thus, requiring a method to be imported to other newer, more advanced database management systems. This blog post will describe how to import database from Microsoft Access to Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. 



1. The first step is to make sure that the Access database is of the `.mdb` format. Note that databases that are made in or after Access 2007 will be in the `.accdb` format, which you will need to convert to the `.mdb` format in order to import to SQL Server. To do that, open the database in Access. Go to **File->Save As**, and choose the **Access 2002-2003 Database(*.mdb)** option. Click **Save As** and save it to your local folder.

2.  Since we want to import a whole database, we are going to create a new empty database in Microsoft SQL Server. Open SL Server Management Studio, and right-click **Database** in the Object Explorer pane and choose **New Database..** Give it a name and configure the settings to your liking. Click **Ok**.

3. After we create a new database, right-click on it and choose **Tasks**, then choose **Import Data**.

4. On the **Data Source** box, choose **Microsoft Access(Microsoft Jet Database Engine)**. Then *Browse* to select the Access database in `.mdb` format that we want to import to SQL Server. Click **Next**.

5. On the next dialog window, choose **SQL Server Native Client** for **Destination**. Then you should confirm the **Server Name** is your database instance name, and choose the new empty database you just created for **Database**. Keep the **Use Window Authentication** checked. Click **Next**.

6. You can specify whether to copy one or more tables from the source database, or use a specific query to manipulate the transfer operation. Since I want to copy all the existing data, I chose to select all the tables from the Access database to the SQL database. Click **Next**.

7. Make sure **Run Immediately** is checked on the next dialog window, click **Next** and then **Finish**. You will see the progress of the transfer operation and get a message saying **The execution was successful** after it's done. Click **Close**.

Now that you have imported the Access database to SQL Server Management Studio, you can manipulate and manage your database in SQL.
