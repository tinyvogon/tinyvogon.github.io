Route 53 is the AWS service that allows you to register your domain and manage your DNS records. However, sometimes you already have a GoDaddy domain, but want to manage its DNS via Route 53. This post will show you how to transfer the DNS from GoDaddy to Route 53 for your convenience.

1. First, you have to make sure you create a hosted zone for your domain on the Route 53 console. Go to Route 53 page and click on **Create hosted zone**.

2. After the wizard page shows up, enter your domain name and your preferred settings for the domain.

3. After the hosted zone is created, you will notice a SOA record and a NS record have been created automatically for you. Take note of all the values in the NS record.

4. Now, go to your GoDaddy domain page. Browse for your domain in DNS > Manage Zones.

5. Scroll down to the nameserver section. You'll see that the nameservers here belong to GoDaddy and different from those in AWS Route 53 console. We want to change these to the Route 53 nameservers. Click on the **Change** button and select to use custom nameservers. Copy and paste all the nameservers from Route 53 NS record for your domain and submit. It takes a few minutes for the nameservers to update, and you'll notice the DNS records in the GoDaddy page going away because GoDaddy no longer controls your DNS records.

6. Once the nameservers are updated, you can start using Route 53 to update your DNS records. This means you can use it to direct traffic to the websites hosted on EC2 instance or other servers. To know how to do that, check out my next blog!
