In the last post I have shown how to create a hosted zone in Route 53. In this blog post I will continue with showing you how to add a record in Route 53's hosted zone so that the hostname will lead to the IP of your website.

1. First, go to the hosted zone in your Route 53 and click **Create record**.

2. A creation page will show up. In the **Record name** field, enter the hostname of your website. Depends on the record type and routing policy, you would choose the approriate settings for your record. For our case, which is to direct a hostname to an IP of the server hosting the website, we will choose **A** record type and **Simple Routing**. Next, enter the IP address of the server to the *Value* box.  Click **Create record** to submit the record, or **Add another record** to add another record to the hosted zone.

5. Afterwards, the record of your website will show up in the hosted zone with the approriate IP. It might take a while for the DNS to propagate the IP address, so wait about 5-10 minutes before trying to go to your website on a browser.
