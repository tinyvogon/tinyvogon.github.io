WinSCP is a helpful tool for file transfer, which you can use to upload any files to any remote server that you have access to. In this case, I will use WinSCP to connect to my EC2 linux instance to upload a file.

**NOTE:** Make sure port 22 (for SFTP) is open by setting up inbound and outbound rules in the EC2 instance's security group.

1. Open WinSCP. On the left side, you can see the file system in your local machine. There will be a window popping up asking you to log in to the remote server.

2. Make sure the File Protocol selected is **SFTP** and port number is **22**. For the Host name field, you can either enter the public IP address of the remote server/ EC2 instance, or the host name of it. If you're connecting to the EC2 linux instance, enter the default username (My Amazon Linux 2 instance's default user is ec2-user).

3. Next, click **Advanced** button. Select **SSH** ---> **Authentication**. This is where you select the private key to access the server.

4. Click on the **...** button next to the Private Key File field. Browse and select your private key with .ppk extension. Click **OK**.

5. Back to the login window, click on the **Save** button below the Username field to save the session so that all the information is saved for the next time you want to login. Enter the Site Name as you wish and click **OK**.

6. After the session is created and all information filled out, click **Login**. There will be a warning saying you are connecting to an unknown server because this is the first time you connect to it. Proceed to click **Yes**.

7. Once you connect to the remote server, you can upload or download any files that you have the permission to between the two sites - your local machine and the remote server.
